# STA-215-Final-Project
My replication package for my STA-215 final project. I took the discography of the band: King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard and analyzed the lengths, topics, and descriptions of songs, what album each is on, as well as how much I personally enjoyed each song. I sought to figure out if I enjoyed a certain type of song more than others and what album I rated the highest statistically.

## **Instructions**
To access and utilize the script, open the "STA215-KALINOWSKI.R" file, which contains the code for my project. To access the dataset, open the "UPDATED FINAL PROJ DATASET - Sheet1 (2).csv" file.

## **Data**
The data collected for this project and the analysis was songs from the studio albums of the band King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard. Being a band that explores a wide range of genres, the main goal of the analysis was to determine which types of songs do listeners like the most and comparing that to which ones I enjoyed the most.
